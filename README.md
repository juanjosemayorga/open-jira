# Next.js: OpenJira App

![Open Jira Project Demo](./public/open-jira-demo-img.png)

The Open Jira App is a clone of the Jira or Trello App written entirely with Next.js and Typescript.
For this app we're leveraging all the things React, Next.js and Typescript have to offer as hooks, SSR, the router, getStaticProps, the strong typing and so.
For the Database it's being used MongoDB and Mongoose, and you'll need Docker to run it.
To build the UI, I used Material UI.
